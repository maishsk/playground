The preceding commands make OpenSSH execute a custom script on login, which records SSH sessions into log files stored in the folder,/var/log/bastion. For durable storage, the log files are copied at a regular interval to an Amazon S3 bucket, using theaws s3 cp command, which follows.

cat > /usr/bin/bastion/sync_s3 << 'EOF'
# Copy log files to S3 with server-side encryption enabled.
# Then, if successful, delete log files that are older than a day.
LOG_DIR="/var/log/bastion/"

At this point, OpenSSH is configured to record SSH sessions and the log files are copied to Amazon S3. In order to determine the origin of any action performed on the Linux instances using SSH, bastion host users are provided with personal user accounts on the bastion host and they use their personal SSH key pair to log in. Each user account receives the minimum required privileges so that bastion host users are unable to disable or tamper with the solution.

To ease the management of user accounts, the SSH public key of each bastion host user is uploaded to an S3 bucket. At a regular interval, the bastion host retrieves the public keys available in this bucket. For each public key, a user account is created if it does not already exist, and the SSH public key is copied to the bastion host to allow the user to log in with this key pair. For example, if the bastion host finds a file, john.pub, in the bucket, which is Johnâ€™s SSH public key, it creates a user account, john, and the public key is copied to /home/john/.ssh/authorized_keys. If an SSH public key were to be removed from the S3 bucket, the bastion host would delete the related user account. Personal user account creations and deletions are logged in /var/log/bastion/users_changelog.txt.

The following commands create a shell script for managing personal user accounts and scheduling a cron job to run the shell script every 5 minutes.

# Bastion host users should log in to the bastion host with
# their personal SSH key pair. The public keys are stored on
# S3 with the following naming convention: "username.pub". This
# script retrieves the public keys, creates or deletes local user
# accounts as needed, and copies the public key to
# /home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys
